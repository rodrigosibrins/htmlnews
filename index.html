                    Amazon has reportedly reached the "late-prototype stage" of its secretive home robot project, codenamed Vesta.
                </p>
                <p>
                    According to 
                    <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/10/22322813/amazon-home-robot-vesta-alexa-project-rumors-specs-report">
                        The Verge
                    </a>, an 
                    <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/amazons-lab126-vesta-project-grows-but-insiders-are-concerned-2021-3?op=
                    1&scrolla=5eb6d68b7fedc32c19ef33b4&r=US&IR=T">
                        Insider
                    </a> report revealed that Amazon is making steady progress on its
                    <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/04/23/amazon-reportedly-making-a-home-robot"> 
                    long-rumored Vesta bot
                    </a> after assigning more than 800 employees to the project. The company reportedly considers the
                    development of its home robot a "top priority, as it has the potential to emerge as one of the biggest and most
                    ambitious new technologies on the market.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Speculative details in the report suggest the device will be around the size of "two small cats," approx. 10 to
                    13 inches wide, and that it will be able to move around a space and navigate an area, just like a furry feline,
                    as the voice-activated assistant will roll about on its wheels. The robot will function as a home automation hub
                    by responding to comments and interfacing with other smart home devices.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Additionally, the robot is said to be equipped with a screen, a microphone, several cameras, and possibly even
                    sensors. These extra features would help to make Amazon's home robot one of the more advanced of its type, with
                    some of the built-in gadgets used to monitor surroundings for environmental factors such as temperature,
                    humidity, and air quality.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The bot could also include a "small compartment" for carrying objects as part of its design, as well as a
                    "waist-high retractable pole with a camera" that could act as another set of eyes when users misplace items
                    around their home. As useful as it all sounds, some employees have reportedly expressed concern over whether the
                    robot will find a customer base if it ever hits the market.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Insider claims an anonymous source "directly involved" with the project said that people were "very skeptical"
                    about the product launch, as there had been apprehension over the possibility of it "turning into another Fire
                    Phone." Amazon had a hard time selling its first-ever phone, with the company reportedly having
                    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rmBIDX0sbAQ&ab_channel=IGN">lost $170 million on the phone</a> shortly
                    after its release.

                    If the Vesta robot does eventually hit the market, then it is believed that it could initially be launched as a
                    "limited invite-only product," as a means of presumably gauging reactions and interest before stocking up the
                    inventory. It sounds like a smart plan to us, especially since a recent study found that
