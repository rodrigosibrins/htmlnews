                    Elon Musk has formally given himself the title of 'Technoking' at Tesla, with his Chief Financial Officer becoming the 'Master of Coin'.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In a <a href="https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001318605/000156459021012981/tsla-8k_20210315.htm">formal SEC filing</a>,
                    Tesla wrote: "Effective as of March 15, 2021, the titles of Elon Musk and Zach Kirkhorn have changed to Technoking
                    of Tesla and Master of Coin, respectively." The two executives will also retain their original CEO and CFO positions and titles alongside the...
                    more unusual new dubbings.
                </p>
                <p>
                    No reasoning has been given for the title changes, and Musk hasn't yet commented on them. Musk's done a lot to tell us that he's not a traditional
                    CEO in recent years, so it makes sense that he'd give himself a whole new title, too.

                <p>
                    While Technoking is a pretty unique title, Master of Coin comes with some <a href="">extremely Game of Thrones-y connotations</a>.
                    If I were Zach Kirkhorn, I'd maybe do some research into Peter Baelish, Tyrion Lannister, and Mace Tyrell, to work out what not to do.
