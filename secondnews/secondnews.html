                    California state naming regulations.

                <p>

                    in 2018 to the tune of $20 million — and lost his chairman title — for tweeting
                    that he had “funding secured” to take Tesla private, something later disputed as accurate.

                    He defiantly reopened the company’s Bay Area plant in May despite a countywide stay-at-home order,
                    daring authorities to arrest him. The Washington Post reported last week that the

                    Musk has somewhat of a cult following, especially online, where he controls his own Twitter account and
                    often engages fans on bitcoin, updates from Tesla and his space exploration company SpaceX.

                <p>
                    Kirkhorn’s new title could be a nod to Tesla’s commitment to cryptocurrency bitcoin. The company
                    <a href="">invested $1.5 billion in bitcoin</a> last month and said it plans to soon accept the
                    cryptocurrency as
                    payment.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Musk has yet to tweet about his new title but on Saturday he seemed to profess his love for techno.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Homo sapiens techno: Loves raves & technology,” he wrote.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A follower replied: “Tesla rave cave at Giga Berlin still planned?”

                    Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for further comment on the significance of the title
                    changes.
